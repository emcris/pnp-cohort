            <h1>What is UI & UX Design?</h1>
            <p>User Interface (UI) design can be defined as the process of creating the style of your webpage. UI designers define a number of aspects when building your website including:color, layout, icons and typography. The way your webpage looks can reinforce your firm's identity, build trust with potential clients, and appeals to a number of users through its ease of access.</p> 
            <p>User Experience (UX) is how a person feels when interfacing (interacting) with the system. This is the unseen, through user testing we are able to orgnize and create an easy to use website based off of real user feedback. A meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success. Put your firm’s best foot forward with a great UI & UX. </p>

            <h1><i>Good</i> UX & UI Design and How It<br> Can Work for <i>You</i>.</h1>
            <p>If a website is hard to navigate you close the page. You wouldn’t invite a future client to your office when the power is cut off and the elevator is broken, why would you expect them to stay on a web page that doesn’t work for them? Instead, welcome a potential client without saying a word. A successful user interface can invite a client into your office in one glance. To better understand how UI & UX works we have taken this page and recreated it by changing a few of the styles to show bad design… this of course is the good design. <b>Click to switch between designs.</b></p>
